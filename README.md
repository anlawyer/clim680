# Climate Data (CLIM 680)
Class work for Climate Data class at GMU. 

## Data set
I'm using data from the [ERA5 post-processed daily statistics reanalysis](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/derived-era5-single-levels-daily-statistics?tab=overview), specifically looking at the 2m temperature variable (`t2m`) for the max daily temperature recorded at 0.25째 x 0.25째 (atmosphere) / 0.5째 x 0.5째 (ocean waves) resolution around the entire globe. 

## Assignment 1
### Multi-panel monthly climatology map

This [project](https://github.com/anlawyer/clim680/blob/main/multipanel-climatology.ipynb) uses `xarray` and `cartopy` to create a facet grid of mean monthly max temperature across the globe:
